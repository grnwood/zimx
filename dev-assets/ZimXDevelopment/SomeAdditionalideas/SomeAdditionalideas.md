Here are some additional useful concepts and features that could enhance your wiki tool for creating collections of pages based on templates or outlines:

1. **Project Templates**: Similar to "New Project / TSD Template," you could have a wide range of pre-defined project templates tailored for different purposes, such as meeting minutes, research plans, product development cycles, content calendars, and more.

2. **Process Outlines**: These are structured collections that guide users through specific processes step-by-step, like onboarding new team members or managing customer support tickets.

3. **Meeting Archives**: A template for organizing meeting notes with predefined sections such as agenda items discussed, decisions made, action items assigned, and follow-up tasks due.

4. **Research Summaries**: Templates that help condense lengthy research papers into key insights, methodologies, findings, and implications in a structured format.

5. **Weekly Planning Pages**: A template for weekly overviews that include planned goals, deadlines, resource allocation, meeting schedules, and time blocks for specific activities.

6. **Performance Reviews**: Collections designed to organize feedback, self-assessments, goals, achievements, areas of improvement, and discussion points for performance review meetings.

7. **Project Roadmaps**: Visual outlines that detail project phases, milestones, key deliverables, dependencies, and timelines in a Gantt chart-like format within the wiki.

8. **Knowledge Base Articles**: A structured approach to documenting company policies, troubleshooting guides, FAQs, and best practices with easy navigation through categories and subcategories.

9. **Event Planning Pages**: Templates that help plan events or webinars with sections for objectives, audience profile, speakers, content outline, promotional materials, schedule, budget, and follow-up tasks.

10. **Task Breakdown Structures (TBS)**: For complex projects, these templates provide a hierarchical view of tasks, subtasks, responsible team members, timelines, and dependencies to ensure comprehensive task management.

11. **Learning Paths**: Customizable outlines for educational resources, courses, or training modules with recommended readings, videos, practical exercises, quizzes, and evaluation criteria.

12. **Sustainability Reports**: Templates designed for compiling environmental impact assessments, carbon footprint analysis, sustainability goals, initiatives, and progress reports in a corporate context.

13. **Strategic Planning Pages**: Outlines for strategic planning sessions that include vision statements, mission statements, objectives, SWOT analyses, action plans, stakeholder engagement strategies, and KPIs to track progress.

14. **Product Development Roadmaps**: For tech teams, these could help map out the development cycle from ideation through to launch, including feature lists, milestones, beta testing phases, and post-launch analysis templates.

15. **Financial Forecasting Pages**: Templates for creating financial projections with sections for revenue streams, expense breakdowns, cash flow forecasts, assumptions, sensitivity analyses, and scenario planning.

Implementing these features would not only make your wiki tool more versatile but also help users organize their thoughts and projects in a structured manner, potentially increasing productivity and collaboration.
