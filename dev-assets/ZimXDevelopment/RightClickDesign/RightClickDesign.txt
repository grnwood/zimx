# RightClickDesign
Created Wednesday 17 December 2025

This is what I want on the right click menu in the editor:

AI Actions...
(Then everything that's currently under edit now)
Page
	Copy link to this Page
	Edit Page Source
	Open Page Location
	Open Page in New Editor
Navigate
	Filter Nav From Here
	Locate in Page Tree
	Link Graph / Navigator
Move Text (new)
  - Requirements
    - If there is a text selected in buffer
    - This will pop the same 'Jump to dialogue' page search and selection (but a smaller version more visible near the mouse cursor).
    - once page target is selected the page will be retrieved over api, and the selected text appended to the END of that file.
    - The text is removed from the current editor, and instead a LINK to the target page is placed in place of the buffer.
