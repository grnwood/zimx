Did a bunch of PRs today surrounding the calendar.
Also worked a lot of the one shot prompting!

Still has some issues with undo/redo buffer :).

my one shot prompt on ibm/granite-4h-tiny:
> "make me a reverse acrostic from english language each word having to do with personal productivity"


Here's a reverse acrostic for each letter of the English alphabet (in reverse order) related to personal productivity:

Z: Zealously pursuing goals with unwavering determination
Y: Yielding to distractions that hinder progress
X: Embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and learning
W: Finding ways to work efficiently, minimizing time wasted
V: Valuing self-care and maintaining a healthy work-life balance
U: Overcoming procrastination through effective goal-setting strategies
T: Tackling tasks with focus and discipline
S: Simplifying processes to enhance productivity
R: Recognizing the importance of regular breaks for mental clarity
Q: Questing for knowledge and skills to improve personal effectiveness
P: Prioritizing tasks based on their impact and urgency
O: Organizing time and resources effectively to achieve desired outcomes
N: Nurturing a growth mindset, continuously seeking improvement
M: Maintaining motivation even in the face of adversity
L: Leveraging strengths while addressing weaknesses for optimal performance
K: Kindling passion for personal development and self-improvement
J: Justifying actions taken with purpose and intentionality
I: Igniting inner drive to accomplish goals consistently
H: Harnessing creativity to overcome obstacles and innovate solutions
G: Garnering support from mentors, peers, and resources when needed
F: Fostering positive habits that contribute to long-term success
E: Embracing flexibility and adaptability in the face of change
Each letter represents a key aspect or strategy for achieving personal productivity.	

> "make me acrostic from the word 'zimx' each word having to do with personal productivity"

Sure, here's an acrostic poem using the letters in "ZIMX" related to personal productivity:

**Z**est for success  
**I**nspire daily goals  
**M**aintain focus and drive  
**X**cellence through discipline and practice  

Each word encapsulates a key aspect of maintaining high levels of productivity.

This is a lot of fun.

No alt-left/right/up/down or vi key navigation.
ctrl-l works, but ctrl-j does not.


My dirty/save buffer doesn't seem to work anymore?
Interesting.

very intersting.
