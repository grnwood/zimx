# ZimXDevelopment
Logbook of all the development efforts on zim. yes!

### Calendar
(x)  I'm seeing some blue dates on a fresh calendar, i only have the 24th defined?  @cal
		 	
(x)  Add Calendar panel  @cal
	move the calendar to its own tab (first)
	put the Journal part of the file tree under it.
	move tasks to its own 
	Tasks can have just the full rail.
	remove 'show jornal' from left nav since it's under calendar.

### Editor
(x)  I still see sometimes my page doesn't save, there is some kind of navigation why to lose the buffer, keep an eye out.  @edit
	pretty sure this is VI navigation (soft keys) doing this, need to make sure it fires a write ALL the time. Gotta hitj ctrl-s for now.
	I found **ONE** : If you activate a link before page saved it loses buffer, need to fix!
(x)  should i use fast api locally if server and ui are in the same place?  @edit
(x)  when you click a link from a floating editor to a anchor, show the animation  @edit
(x)  found the vi ; key bug, when i'm in caps it works, when lower it doesn't (maybe win32 only)  @edit
  ( )  figure out a way to not allow crazy links to get generated and pasted @edit				￼
  			![paste_image_001](./paste_image_001.png)make colon-link (: somelink) processing smarter, like if its in a the middle of the sentence
 		or 8 : 56pm
 		of  This : That  <-- not a link.		
( )  add find and replace functionality @edit
( ) implement the full text search with your chatgpt vetted feature @edit

### Git
( )  git support: simple 'version this vault' @edit
	maybe version this vault, or page... with a note.
	System pref:  git control for vault?  default no.
	Requirements: 
		git installed in OS and on path. (or warning)
		attempt a git init.  Setup a remote origin and auto push?  (auto push on commit?)
		
### Tasks
(x)  support hiearchy assignment  @task
( ) if all tasks on a tag are complete, tag comes out of tags filter (unless show completed is selected)  @task
(x) if tree is filtered, filter the tasks panel based on tree and sub pages? @task
	(show red filtered message next to tags label)
( )  need a way to AI chat with my tasks. @task
( ) need a way to print my tasks (esp. the current filter... print to browser?) @task
( )  double check the searching seems to not be filtering right (tags and tasks text?) @task

### Page Templages
( )  ctrl-n should default to the `New Page` template.  @page
( ) Add some more?  @edit
( )  need to fix template engine. add a open template folder (users .zimx folder overrides). @page
	probably add !qotd! in there too for fun, any others?
	
### Printing
( )  print to browser[:print_to_browser|] feature?  @print  <2025-12-01

### Ai Stuff
( )  need to add chroma/rag into chat.  @ai
	* add the page text into chroma by default?
	* (#) hash tag loads list of file attachements from page?
	* (@) allows linking to any other page in the notebook
	  * How to handle subfolders, etc?
	* Delete has to remove from chroma or get to big.
	* Chroma per chat?  or global chroma file for the whole app?
( )  i lost my right click ai actions in the ai chat window text, lets put them back. @ai
( )  when i send in ai prompts from main editor it doesn't register in that as sent, lets fix @ai
