# ZimXDevelopment

Logbook of all the development efforts on zim.

#### Performance
( )  find out what's closing the app on: @zimx @perf
 	- reset ai chat
 	- delete files sometimes
 	- change vaults...

### Calendar
(x)  I'm seeing some blue dates on a fresh calendar, i only have the 24th defined? @zimx
		 	
(x)  Add Calendar panel @zimx @cal
	move the calendar to its own tab (first)
	put the Journal part of the file tree under it.
	move tasks to its own tab
	Tasks can have just the full rail.
	remove 'show jornal' from left nav since it's under calendar.

### Server
( )  rename pages @zimx @server
( )  duplicate page @zimx @server

### Links and Nav
( )  If i ctrl-shift-l a location and paste into editor it does not index a link @zimx @links
( )  support file links on either OS, it not http, if not in wiki links, then file link? @zimx @links
( )  when i navigate back to a page, restore last caret position, currently only works on recent lnks @zimx @links
	aka. save cursor position in all files, refactor out the 'history only' logic.
( )  still able to get a double folder link somehow? See `/ZimXDevelopment/FolderHiding/FolderHiding/FolderHiding.txt`
	I *think* this is defining or activating a link in the middle of a task line and activating before save maybe?
	
### Task Panel
( )  make strikeouts format more visually (at least on windows) @zimx @tasks
( )  if typing a tag and in tag mode, disable the j/k keys so i can finish typing the tag @zimx @tasks
( )  support hierachy of tasks @zimx @tasks
	- ( ) task 1  <at>-label
	-		() task 2 (no label)
	
	still shows up in task panel with subtask indented.
	
### Editor
Reference [:FormattingTest|]
(x)  I still see sometimes my page doesn't save, there is some kind of navigation why to lose the buffer, keep an eye out. @zimx @editor
	pretty sure this is VI navigation (soft keys) doing this, need to make sure it fires a write ALL the time. Gotta hitj ctrl-s for now.
	I found **ONE** : If you activate a link before page saved it loses buffer, need to fix!
( )  should i use fast api locally if server and ui are in the same place? @zimx @editor
( )  don't let the page vieport scroll past the end of buffer (arrow keys) @zimx @editor
( )  editing updates @zimx @editor
	-Make ctrl-t put either a selection or multiline in `fixed width`.
	-Make fixed width actually look fixed width in the editor.
	-Make strikethrough ctrl-k work on multi lines. 
( )  Allow opening  in it's own window [:OpenWindow|OpenWindow]  @zimx @editor
( )  Allow filtering the nav bar by current page and sub folders [:FolderHiding|FolderHiding] @zimx @editor
( )  Fonts: Can we change editor font and UI font in the system settings? @zimx @editor
( )  Toc widget: promote and demote heading tags @zimx @editor

### Page Templages
( )  ctrl-n should default to the `New Page` template.  @zimx @templates
( ) Add some more? @zimx @templates
 
### Printing
( )  add the [:print_to_browser|print to browser] feature? @zimx @print <2025-12-01

### Ai Stuff
( )  need to add chroma/rag into chat. @zimx @ai
F	• add the page text into chroma by default?
	* (#) hash tag loads list of file attachements from page?
	* (@) allows linking to any other page in the notebook
	  * How to handle subfolders, etc?
	* Delete has to remove from chroma or get to big.
	* Chroma per chat?  or global chroma file for the whole app
