	# ZimXDevelopment

Logbook of all the development efforts on zim.

### Calendar

( )  I'm seeing some blue dates on a fresh calendar, i only have the 24th defined? @zimx
		￼	
( )  Add Calendar panel @zimx
	move the calendar to its own tab (first)
	put the Journal part of the file tree under it.
	move tasks to its own tab
	Tasks can have just the full rail.
	remove 'show jornal' from left nav since it's under calendar.
	
### Editor
( )  I still see sometimes my page doesn't save, there is some kind of navigation why to lose the buffer, keep an eye out. @zimx
	pretty sure this is VI navigation (soft keys) doing this, need to make sure it fires a write ALL the time. Gotta hitj ctrl-s for now.
	I found **ONE** : If you activate a link before page saved it loses buffer, need to fix!
( )  should i use fast api locally if server and ui are in the same place? @zimx
( )  don't let the page vieport scroll past the end of buffer (arrow keys) @zimx

### Page Templages
( )  ctrl-n should default to the `New Page` template.  @zimx
( ) Add some more? @zimx

### Printing
( )  print to browser feature? @zimx  <2025-12-01

### Ai Stuff
( )  need to add chroma/rag into chat. @zimx
	* add the page text into chroma by default?
	* (#) hash tag loads list of file attachements from page?
	* (@) allows linking to any other page in the notebook
	  * How to handle subfolders, etc?
	* Delete has to remove from chroma or get to big.
	* Chroma per chat?  or global chroma file for the whole app?
