# OpenWindow
Created Tuesday 25 November 2025

Goal:
Right click on a nav item, or bookmarks, or recent page button.
Right click... "open a `new` window".

New window opens with **just the editor** all other elements disabled
	includes left nave
	includes entire right tab panel.

This window is editable within itself.
No alt-left/right/up/down or vi key navigation.
ctrl-l works, but ctrl-j does not.

Any links clicked will navigate in the 'main' window, not the currently opened window.
