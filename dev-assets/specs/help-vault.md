# ZimX Help Vault

This document defines the content and tone of the built-in Help Vault. The Help Vault is a real ZimX vault that ships with the app and opens in a separate window. It teaches ZimX by example: every page is a normal Markdown note, cross-linked like a real knowledge base.

## Requirements
- Create an empty vault at `zimx/help-vault`.
- Populate it with ZimX-format Markdown pages that explain the app from a user perspective.
- Add a top-level **Help** menu with a **Documentation** action and `F1` shortcut.
- Launch the Help Vault in a new ZimX window when **Documentation** is selected.
- Bundle the Help Vault in the PyInstaller build (`packaging/zimx.spec`).

## Content Strategy
- Write for everyday users first, with a friendly, action-oriented tone.
- Keep pages short; link out to deeper topics.
- Use real ZimX link styles and show off labeled links.
- Include quick steps and small examples rather than long prose.
- Keep wording consistent with ZimX design principles: local-first, fast, explicit AI, no lock-in.

## Vault Structure
Use the following page set. Each page is a standalone Markdown file. The names below should be treated as note titles (and thus page names).

### Advanced Setup (Tech)
**Purpose:** Power-user and multi-device setups.

## Design Philosophy (Short Form)
Include a page with a concise, skimmable list of principles. Avoid duplication. Use this exact tone and keep it tight:

- Your notes stay yours. Everything is plain Markdown.
- Works offline by default.
- Fast, focused, and distraction-free.
- AI is opt-in and visible.
- No lock-in, ever.
- Organize your way: links, tags, tasks, or all three.
- Built for long-term thinking.

## Cross-Linking Guidelines
- Link every page to at least two other pages.
- Use labeled links (e.g., `[Editing Basics|Learn editing shortcuts]`).
- Keep link labels clear and action-oriented.

## Tone and Formatting Rules
- Use short paragraphs and bullet lists.
- Avoid marketing fluff; be direct and helpful.
- Show examples in fenced code blocks where relevant.
- Keep headings consistent: H1 for the title, H2 for sections.
