write a obsidian importer similar to  the zim importer on file / import.

this will ask for os level obsidian file folder to read as input.  cycle through each and add the appropriate pages in zimx translating .md into .txt files, resolving and rewriting any links, and resolving any attachment links into the proper zimx attachment folder locations under each page.

structure is in
obsidian-sample vault.

hint:
obsidian vault has ...

New Folder/New Note.md

in Zimx that should be

New Folder/New Note/New Note.txt

also

MainNode.md at the root would be 

MainNote/MainNote.txt   in zimx.

each .md file that has a relative link to attachment

eg.
![[Pasted image 20251216232514.png]]
