            ZimX is not for dashboards, metrics, or turning your life into a system. It is for
            writing things down and being able to find them again.

              Notes live on your computer as real files you control. No accounts, no

              You open a page and type. Organization emerges naturally as you link ideas
              together over time. ZimX never demands structure upfront.

              ZimX stays quiet when you need focus and reveals connections when you need
              context. The tool adapts to you, not the other way around.

              A checkbox is still a checkbox. A link is still a link. ZimX avoids turning
              basic writing into heavy workflows.

          If ZimX disappeared tomorrow, your notes would still be there — readable, editable,

          ZimX only drops a hidden '.zimx' folder and a couple of sqllite databases in your vault folder.
          If you delete those, ZimX simply rebuilds its context and indexes from your plain text files.
          <b>YOUR NOTES</b> are <b>ALWAYS</b> the source of truth and ZimX just builds around them.

        <h2>A thank you to <a href="https://zim-wiki.org/">Zim Wiki</a>.</h2>
        <p>
          ZimX exists because <a href="https://zim-wiki.org/">Zim</a> proved the model. I used Zim for over a decade with
          thousands of folders and notes. It was bulletproof, stood the test of time, and
          never lost a page. That durability is the bar ZimX aims to keep.
          As a young consultant in 2007, I found Zim Wiki and it changed how I worked. Finally, I had a tool
          that let me write naturally, link ideas together, and keep everything local. Over
          the years, Zim became my trusted brain for projects, research, and personal notes.
          When I started building ZimX, I wanted to honor that legacy while improving the
          experience with modern design, performance, and features.
