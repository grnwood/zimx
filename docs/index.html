ZimX

A calm place to return to — and a powerful place to organize your thinking.

ZimX is a local-first workspace for notes, tasks, and ideas.

It can be a quiet journal you visit between meetings.
Or it can become your main brain — the one place you trust to hold everything together.

You decide the depth.
ZimX meets you there.

A journal when you want it

ZimX includes a built-in daily journal — always there, never required.

Each day is a simple note page:

• A place to jot down plans written earlier
• A place to capture what actually happened
• A place to land when your day is fragmented across tools

You don’t have to “journal.”
The page is just there when you need it.

A safe haven from noisy tools

Modern work lives everywhere:
Email. Chat. Calendars. Tickets. Docs. Dashboards.

ZimX doesn’t try to replace them.

It gives you a **home base**.

• Capture notes from meetings
• Write down decisions once
• Track follow-ups where they make sense
• Link out to Slack, Teams, Jira, Confluence, docs, and more

When you need to remember, you don’t hunt — you return.

Notes that stay local and last

Everything in ZimX lives on your computer as plain text.

• No accounts
• No subscriptions
• No cloud lock-in
• Full offline use

Your notes remain readable and usable — even outside ZimX.

This is software that respects your work.

Tasks that live inside your notes

Tasks in ZimX aren’t a separate system.

They’re part of your writing:

• A checkbox in a meeting note
• A follow-up on today’s page
• A reminder linked to a project

ZimX can surface what’s due or upcoming — without pulling tasks away from the context that gives them meaning.

---

A calendar that reflects real work

In ZimX, the calendar is a set of dated note pages — not a grid of time slots.

Each day:

• May contain plans written earlier
• Becomes a running log of what actually happened
• Links out to clients, projects, and ideas

The calendar gives you the date.
ZimX captures the day.

---

See your thinking take shape

ZimX includes a visual link graph that shows how everything connects:

• Days to projects
• Notes to ideas
• Work to outcomes

The graph grows naturally as you write — a living map of how your thinking evolves.

It’s there when it helps, invisible when it doesn’t.

Simple enough to visit. Strong enough to rely on.

ZimX works whether you:

• Drop in occasionally
• Keep it open all day
• Use the journal lightly
• Let it become your trusted backbone

There’s no system to maintain.
No pressure to optimize.
Just a dependable place to think.
