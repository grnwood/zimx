            ZimX does not force a workflow. It gives you a steady home base, then lets a system

          <h2>Mega brain for fast moving professional</h2>
          <p>
            I work for a large, fast-moving consulting firm with a half dozen clients and
            projects at any given time. My calendar is full of meetings that I need to lead,
            participate in, or summarize, with action items and follow-ups everywhere. When
            project managers miss things or get overwhelmed, I still have to keep track of
            the details.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, I have to track billable time. ZimX lets me see the day at a
            glance, track what time was spent, and link every meeting to the work it connects
            to. As the graph grows, the relationships between projects, people, and outcomes
            become obvious.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also keep a fast knowledge base of reference material. Sometimes I'm only a few
            steps ahead of the people on a call. ZimX lets me file important notes quickly,
            recall them instantly, and link them to whatever I'm working on right now. When
            I need to share, I can print or export a page without rewriting it elsewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have several thousand folders, and gigabytes of notes in ZimX. It never slows
            down, never loses data, and never gets in the way. It just works.
          </p>
          <p class="quote">
            The page does not dictate the day. It receives it.
