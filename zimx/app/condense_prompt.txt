Task: You are given a conversation transcript between a user and an AI assistant. Your job is to condense this history into 
a concise context seed that can be used to initialize a future conversation.

Goal: Extract only the durable, session-relevant information — not the transient details — so the next session starts with the right awareness of the user’s needs, preferences, and ongoing threads.
Requirements:
Summarize only persistent context:
Long-term user preferences
Ongoing projects or multi-step tasks
User goals, constraints, or working assumptions
Important facts the assistant should remember next time

Exclude:
Greetings
Temporary or time-sensitive items
Ephemeral discussions not likely to matter again
Assistant mistakes, debugging steps, or irrelevant chatter

Output format:
[Context Seed]
- {bullet points of persistent facts}
- {ongoing tasks or workstreams}
- {user preferences & style notes}

Keep it short: no more than 10–15 bullets.
Be accurate: do not infer facts not clearly present in the transcript.
