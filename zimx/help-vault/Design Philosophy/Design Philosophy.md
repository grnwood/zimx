# Design Philosophy

ZimX is for people who think in notes.

- Your notes stay yours. Everything is plain Markdown.
- Works offline by default.
- Fast, focused, and distraction-free.
- AI is opt-in and visible.
- No lock-in, ever.
- Organize your way: links, tags, tasks, or all three.
- Built for long-term thinking.
