# Design Philosophy

ZimX is designed as a tool for long-term thinking: fast, local, and intentionally "un-magical".

## Core Principles

### Your notes. Your machine. Your rules.
ZimX is local-first. Plain Markdown. No lock-in. Ever. Everything is stored locally in folders and `.md` files (legacy `.txt` supported). No proprietary cloud, no fear of losing your work.

### Works offline. Always.
Full functionality offline. AI, search, and navigation never disappear just because you're on a plane or the Wi-Fi is down. No internet? No problem.

### Fast enough to stay out of your way
No lag. No bloat. Just typing, thinking, and moving on. ZimX is designed to feel immediate—minimal chrome, maximum writing and navigation speed.

### Find anything instantly
Powerful search, backlinks, filters, and AI context help you surface the right note at the right time—even years later.

### AI when you want it. Silent when you don't.
Use AI to summarize, rewrite, explain, or organize your notes—only when you ask. ZimX never "helpfully" rewrites your work. Nothing happens behind your back. Every AI action is explicit, visible, and reversible.

### No magic. No surprises.
You always know what changed and why. Edits are tracked and written to disk as you work. If you ever want to validate "where the truth lives", open the page file in an external editor—it's the same content.

### Organize your way. Not ours.
Trees, links, tags, tasks, or all of them together. ZimX adapts to how your brain works instead of forcing a workflow.

### Starts simple, grows with you
Use ZimX as a clean note app on day one. Unlock advanced features like templates, filters, and automation only when you're ready.

### Keyboard-first. Flow-friendly.
Stay in flow with powerful keyboard navigation and editing. No constant mouse hunting. If your hands leave the keyboard, something went wrong.

### Built for years, not weeks.
ZimX is designed for notes you'll revisit months or years later—not just quick captures you'll forget tomorrow.

### Your notes remain readable anywhere
Even without ZimX, your notes are just Markdown files. Open them in any editor, anytime. They're just files. Open them anywhere. Anytime.

### Power without the mess.
Features are modular and focused. No feature soup. No buried settings. Just composable tools. ZimX stays fast and responsive, even with large note collections.

### Control how much AI you want
Use local models, remote models, or none at all. ZimX never forces an AI subscription mindset.

### Leave anytime. Take everything.
No exports. No migrations. No hostage data. If you ever leave, your notes come with you.

## What This Means In Practice
- You can organize by folders, links, tags, tasks, or any combination
- ZimX is meant to be "boring on disk": predictable structure, easy backups, easy diffs
- Advanced features are additive—you can ignore them until you want them
- This isn't a publishing tool. It's a thinking tool. Designed for thinkers, not influencers.

## ZimX Isn't For Everyone
If you want a social feed for your notes, or AI to think for you, or you're fine with cloud lock-in, or you prefer pretty over durable—ZimX won't be your tool.

But if you want a fast, local, AI-augmented thinking space you actually own—ZimX probably is.
