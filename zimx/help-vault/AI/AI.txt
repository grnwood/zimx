# AI

AI in ZimX is optional and intentionally explicit.

**AI when you want it. Silent when you don't.** ZimX never "helpfully" rewrites your work. You stay in control.

## Core Principles

### No magic. No surprises.
- Nothing runs "in the background"
- You choose the model/server
- You choose when to ask for help
- Every AI action is visible, intentional, and reversible

### AI helps you think, not replace you
The goal is to support thinking:
- Summarize long notes
- Rewrite for clarity
- Explain technical concepts
- Organize messy brainstorms
- Generate diagrams

**Not** to generate content you haven't thought about.

### Control how much AI you want
- Use local models for privacy and offline work
- Use remote models for more capability
- Or use none at all—ZimX works great without AI

**Use your own AI—or none at all.** Local models. Remote models. Zero models. Your call.

## Getting Started with AI

### Step 1: Setup
Configure your AI connection:
- [:AI:Setup|AI Setup]

### Step 2: Choose Your Workflow
Pick the AI feature that matches your need:

**Chat** (for conversations and iterative work):
- [:AI:Chat|AI Chat]

**One-Shot** (for quick transformations):
- [:AI:One_Shot|One-Shot Prompting]

**PlantUML** (for diagramming):
- [:AI:PlantUML|PlantUML Diagrams]

## AI Features Overview

### AI Chat
Open a conversation with context from your vault:
- Ask questions about your notes
- Request summaries of pages
- Get help organizing ideas
- Iterate on content

See [:AI:Chat|AI Chat] for details.

### One-Shot Prompting
Quick transformations on selected text:
- Summarize
- Expand
- Rewrite for clarity
- Fix grammar
- Change tone
- Extract action items

See [:AI:One_Shot|One-Shot Prompting] for details.

### PlantUML Diagrams
Generate and edit diagrams:
- Describe a diagram in natural language
- AI generates PlantUML code
- Render and edit inline

See [:AI:PlantUML|PlantUML Diagrams] for details.

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
AI can search your vault for relevant context:
- Ask questions about your notes
- AI finds relevant pages automatically
- Answers are grounded in your content

Requires indexing setup (see [:AI:Setup|AI Setup]).

## Privacy and Offline Work

### Local Models
Run AI entirely on your machine:
- No internet required
- Complete privacy—nothing leaves your computer
- Works on planes, in secure environments, etc.

**Common local options**:
- Ollama (easy to set up)
- LM Studio
- llamafile

### Remote Models
Use cloud AI services:
- More powerful models
- Faster inference
- Requires internet connection
- Data sent to provider

**Common remote options**:
- OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Google (Gemini)
- Azure OpenAI

**Works offline. Always.** ZimX core features never require internet. AI is the only exception—and only if you choose remote models.

## When to Use AI

### Good Use Cases
- **Summarizing**: Condense meeting notes or research
- **Organizing**: Structure brainstorm dumps
- **Explaining**: Get help understanding complex topics
- **Rewriting**: Improve clarity or change tone
- **Diagramming**: Visualize system architecture or flows

### Questionable Use Cases
- **Generating content wholesale**: AI-generated fluff doesn't help you think
- **Replacing research**: Use AI to process your research, not replace it
- **Avoiding writing**: The act of writing clarifies thinking

**Built for real thinking, not content farming.** Use AI to enhance your thinking, not avoid it.

## AI Doesn't Replace Good Practices

You still need:
- Clear page organization (see [:Links_and_Backlinks|Links and Backlinks])
- Consistent tagging (see [:Search_and_Filtering|Search and Filtering])
- Regular review and curation

AI makes these practices more powerful—it doesn't replace them.

## Disabling AI
Don't want AI? No problem:
- Don't configure an AI server
- AI features simply won't appear
- ZimX remains a fast, focused Markdown editor

**Designed for thinkers, not influencers.** AI is a tool, not a requirement.
