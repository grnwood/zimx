# Search and Filtering

ZimX is built for "find it later" without needing a perfect folder structure.

**Find anything instantly.** Powerful search, backlinks, filters, and AI context help you surface the right note at the right time—even years later.

## Find In The Current Page
Use `Ctrl+F` to search within the current page:
- Highlights all matches
- Navigate with `Enter` or arrow keys
- Great for long notes or finding specific sections

## Search Across The Vault
**Global search** is for when you remember *what* you wrote but not *where* you put it.

**How to use**:
1. Open the search panel (usually visible on the right)
2. Enter your search query
3. Results show matching pages with context
4. Click a result to open that page

**Tips**:
- Search for a distinctive phrase instead of a single common word
- Use tags consistently (see below) so search results stay meaningful
- Combine search with tree filtering for focused searches

## Tags
Tags are written directly in text using `@tag`:

**Examples**:
- `@work`, `@home`, `@idea`, `@reading`, `@wait`
- `@high`, `@low` (priorities)
- `@project-phoenix`, `@client-x`

**Why tags work well**:
- **No magic. No surprises.** They're not "metadata you might lose"—they're right in your note
- Easy to search for: just search `@work` to find work-related items
- Works with tasks (see [:Tasks|Tasks])
- Visible when you read the file in any editor

## Filtering the Tree
Narrow your focus to a specific subtree:

**How**:
- Right-click a page in tree → "Filter to this subtree"
- Or use a bookmark → "Filter nav from here"

**Why**:
- Reduces visual clutter when working on a specific project
- Focuses search and navigation
- Useful for large vaults with many areas

**Clear filter**: Use the "Clear nav filter" action when done.

## Link Navigator
See connections between pages:
- Open with `G,L`
- Shows outgoing links (where this page points)
- Shows incoming links/backlinks (where this page is referenced)

This is search through relationships—often more useful than text search when you're trying to understand context.

See [:Links_and_Backlinks|Links and Backlinks] for more.

## AI-Assisted Search (Optional)
If you have AI configured (see [:AI|AI]), you can use AI to find relevant pages:

- Ask questions in AI chat
- AI searches your vault and provides context-aware answers
- Useful when you remember the concept but not the exact words

**AI when you want it. Silent when you don't.** This feature is optional—ZimX works great without it.

## Search Strategies

### Strategy 1: Tag Everything That Matters
Use consistent tags from the start:
- Tag meeting notes with attendees: `@john @sarah`
- Tag ideas with status: `@draft @in-progress @done`
- Tag by project: `@project-name`

### Strategy 2: Create Index Pages
Build "hub" pages that link to related content:
- Create a "Projects" page with links to all projects
- Create an "Ideas" page with links to brainstorming notes
- Use these as navigation shortcuts

### Strategy 3: Use Dates
Include dates in task and journal pages:
- Tasks: `<2025-12-31` (due date)
- Journal entries use date-based page names
- Search by date range becomes easy

### Strategy 4: Trust Search
Don't obsess over perfect organization:
- Capture quickly in Inbox or daily journal
- Tag roughly while capturing
- Trust search to find it later
- Refine organization when patterns emerge

**Starts simple, grows with you.** Don't over-organize early—let structure emerge naturally.
