# ZimX Help Vault

Welcome to the built-in documentation vault for ZimX.

This vault is just a vault: plain folders + plain `.md` Markdown files (legacy `.txt` still works). You can browse it like any other vault, copy parts into your own notes, and even customize it if you want.

## A Note On Links
ZimX supports wiki-style links in this form:

`[:Some_Page|Nice label]`

If a page name has spaces, use underscores in the link target (ZimX resolves it back to spaces).
