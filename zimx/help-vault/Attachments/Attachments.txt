# Attachments

ZimX supports working with files (like images, PDFs, documents) alongside your notes.

**Your notes remain readable anywhere.** Attachments are stored in simple folders next to your page files.

## How Attachments Work
Each page can have attachments stored in a special folder:

```
My Page/
  My Page.txt          (the page content)
  attachments/         (attachment storage)
    image.png
    document.pdf
```

**Boring on disk, powerful in practice.** This simple structure means:
- Easy to back up (just copy folders)
- Easy to share (send the whole page folder)
- Easy to access (open files with any tool)

## Pasting Images
In many environments you can paste an image directly:

1. Copy an image to clipboard (screenshot, browser, etc.)
2. Click in the editor where you want the image
3. Press `Ctrl+V`

ZimX:
- Saves the image into the page's attachment folder
- Generates a unique filename
- Inserts a Markdown image reference: `![image](attachments/paste_image_001.png)`

## Adding Other Files
**Drag and drop** (if supported):
- Drag a file from your file manager
- Drop it into the editor

Or **manually**:
1. Copy file into the page's `attachments/` folder
2. Reference it in Markdown:
   - Images: `![description](attachments/filename.png)`
   - Links: `[Document](attachments/document.pdf)`

## Attachments Panel
Open the Attachments panel: **G,M** or `Go → Attachments`

**Features**:
- View all attachments for the current page
- Click to open in your default application
- See attachment sizes and types
- Manage (delete, rename, etc.)

## Viewing Attachments

### Images
Inline images render in the editor preview.

### PDFs and Documents
Click the link to open in your default application.

### AI on PDFs (Optional)
If you have AI configured with PDF support (see [:AI|AI]):
- Ask questions about PDF content
- Summarize documents
- Extract information

**AI when you want it.** This is optional—attachments work fine without AI.

## A Good Pattern
When you attach something, write a short explanation:

```markdown
# Research Notes

Attached the whitepaper on distributed systems.

![whitepaper screenshot](attachments/distributed-systems.png)

**Key points**:
- Consistency vs. availability trade-offs
- CAP theorem implications
- Our system should prioritize...

**Next steps**:
- [ ] Discuss with team @work
- [ ] Draft architecture proposal
```

**Built for long-term thinking.** Future you will thank present you for the context.

## Attachment Storage Location
Attachments live next to the page:
```
Vault/
  Projects/
    Project Phoenix/
      Project Phoenix.txt
      attachments/
        diagram.png
        spec.pdf
```

This keeps everything together—if you move or share the page folder, attachments come along.

## Managing Attachments on Disk
Since attachments are just files:
- Use your file manager to view/organize them
- Use any image viewer, PDF reader, etc.
- Back up with your normal backup tools
- Version control with git if desired

**No lock-in.** Attachments don't require ZimX to access.

## Image Formats Supported
Common image formats work:
- PNG, JPG, JPEG
- GIF (static and animated)
- SVG (vector graphics)
- BMP, WEBP

## Linking to External Files
You can also link to files outside the vault:

```markdown
[External Document](file:///home/user/Documents/report.pdf)
```

Use absolute paths or relative paths as needed.

## Best Practices

### 1. Name Images Descriptively
Rename pasted images to something meaningful:
- `paste_image_001.png` → `architecture-diagram.png`
- Helps when searching files
- Helps when reviewing old notes

### 2. Keep Attachments Small
Large files slow down backups and sync:
- Compress images when possible
- Link to external files for very large media
- Consider storing large datasets outside the vault

### 3. Document Your Attachments
Don't just paste and forget:
- Explain what it shows
- Explain why it matters
- Link to related notes

### 4. Clean Up Unused Attachments
Periodically review the `attachments/` folder:
- Delete images that are no longer referenced
- Archive old versions
- Keep the vault lean
