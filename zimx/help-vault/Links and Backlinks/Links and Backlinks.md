# Links and Backlinks

Links are the core of a ZimX vault. They turn notes into a connected system.

## Link Format
Use a wiki-style link with an optional label:

`[:Page_Name|Nice label]`
	Right click, Page... Edit Page Source to see the source for links.
	
## Backlinks

Right click, Navigate... Link Graph / Navigator.
