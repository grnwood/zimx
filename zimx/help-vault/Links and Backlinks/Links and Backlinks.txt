# Links and Backlinks

Links are how ZimX turns folders of Markdown into a connected "thinking space".

**Organize your way. Not ours.** Trees, links, tags, tasks, or all of them together. ZimX adapts to how your brain works.

## Wiki-Style Links (Recommended)
ZimX supports wiki-style links with a target and an optional label:

**Basic syntax**:
```
[:Page_Name]
[:Page_Name|Nice Label]
```

**Nested pages** (use colons):
```
[:AI:Setup]
[:AI:Setup|Setting up AI]
```

**Notes**:
- Use underscores in targets for spaces (`Getting_Started` → `Getting Started`)
- Use `:` to make the link root-relative (so it always resolves the same way)
- Links are case-sensitive but ZimX tries to be forgiving

## Creating Links
**Method 1: Type manually**
Just type `[:Page_Name|Label]` in the editor.

**Method 2: Insert Link Dialog**
1. Select text you want to turn into a link
2. Right-click → "Insert Link"
3. Choose the target page
4. ZimX wraps the selected text as the link label

**Method 3: Paste as Link**
1. Copy text from another page
2. Select target text in current page
3. Use "Paste as Link" action (if available)

## Following Links
- **Click** a link to navigate to that page
- Links open in the same editor (use history to go back)
- If the target page doesn't exist, ZimX can create it

## Backlinks
**Find anything instantly.** The Link Navigator panel shows:
- **Outgoing links**: Where this page links to
- **Incoming links**: Where this page is referenced from

Open Link Navigator: `G,L` or `Go → Link Navigator`

Backlinks let you discover where a note is referenced—crucial for understanding context over time.

## Why Link So Much?
**Built for long-term thinking.** Links create a web of related ideas that grows more valuable over time:

- Faster navigation than the tree once your vault grows
- Build "hub" pages that act as dashboards
- Discover unexpected connections through backlinks
- Create a personal knowledge graph naturally

## A Simple Pattern
Create a page per concept and a page per project:

- **Concept pages** (evergreen): "Search", "Meeting Notes", "PlantUML", "Design Patterns"
- **Project pages** (time-bound): "Project Phoenix", "Q4 Planning", "Client X Migration"

Then link projects to concepts as you use them. Over time, concept pages accumulate backlinks showing where they've been applied.

## HTTP Links
Standard Markdown links also work:
```
[Google](https://google.com)
<https://example.com>
```

These open in your default browser.

## Example Hub Page Pattern
Create a page called "Projects" or "Work" that links to all active projects:

```markdown
# Projects

## Active
- [:Project_Phoenix|Project Phoenix] @high
- [:Client_X_Migration|Client X] @work

## Archived
- [:Q3_Planning|Q3 Planning] (completed 2025-09-30)
```

Now you have a dashboard you can bookmark or link from other pages.

## Next Steps
- Learn about searching and tags: [:Search_and_Filtering|Search and Filtering]
- Track project tasks: [:Tasks|Tasks]
- Understand the navigation system: [:Navigation|Navigation]
