# Tasks

ZimX supports task lists inside normal Markdown notes.

## Task Syntax
Use standard Markdown checkboxes:

```md
- [ ] Do the thing
- [x] Done already
```

## Working with Tasks
- Toggle tasks in place.
- Keep tasks alongside real notes instead of a separate system.
- Use search and filters to find open tasks.
