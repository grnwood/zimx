# Tasks

ZimX can extract tasks from your Markdown and show them in a dedicated panel.

**Organize your way.** Track work using trees, links, tags, or tasks—whatever fits your workflow.

## Task Syntax
Use Markdown checkboxes anywhere in your notes:

```markdown
- [ ] Write documentation page
- [x] Fix a bug
- [ ] Review pull request
```

**ZimX extracts these automatically** and shows them in the Task panel.

## Enhanced Task Features
Add metadata inline with your tasks:

```markdown
- [ ] Draft proposal @work <2025-12-31
- [ ] Buy groceries @home @errands
- [ ] Research topic !!! >2025-12-20
```

**Conventions**:
- `@tag`: Tag the task (e.g., `@work`, `@home`, `@client-x`)
- `<YYYY-MM-DD`: Due date
- `>YYYY-MM-DD`: Start date
- `!`, `!!`, `!!!`: Priority (more `!` = higher priority)

**No magic. No surprises.** Everything is visible in plain text. Open the page in any editor and you'll see the same thing.

## Task Panel
Open the Task panel: **G,T** or `Go → Tasks`

**Features**:
- View all tasks across your vault
- Filter by tag, date, priority, status
- Search within tasks
- Click a task to jump to its source page
- Check/uncheck tasks directly in the panel

## Hierarchy and Context
Tasks can be nested:

```markdown
- [ ] Project Phoenix @project
  - [ ] Design mockups @design
  - [ ] Implement backend @dev
  - [ ] Write tests @dev
```

ZimX preserves the hierarchy so you understand task relationships.

## Suggested Workflow

### 1. Capture Tasks Where They Happen
Don't force tasks into a separate "task list":
- Add tasks to meeting notes
- Add tasks to project pages
- Add tasks to daily journal entries

**Built for long-term thinking.** Tasks live alongside the context that created them.

### 2. Use Tags to Separate Contexts
```markdown
- [ ] Review contracts @work @legal
- [ ] Fix leaky faucet @home
- [ ] Read research paper @reading @someday
```

Filter the task panel by tag to see context-specific tasks.

### 3. Review Regularly
Use the Task panel to review:
- What's due soon? (filter by date)
- What's high priority? (filter by `!`)
- What's blocked? (use `@wait` tag)
- What can I do now? (filter by context like `@work`)

### 4. Mark Complete, Don't Delete
Change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`:
```markdown
- [x] Completed task @done
```

**Why?** Completed tasks provide a record of what you've accomplished. They're useful when writing status reports or remembering what you did.

## Integration with Calendar
Combine tasks with dated journal pages:

**Example daily page**:
```markdown
# 2025-12-18

## Tasks
- [x] Morning standup @work
- [ ] Review PR #123 @dev
- [ ] Draft blog post @writing

## Notes
Meeting with Sarah went well. Discussed...
```

See [:Calendar|Calendar] for more on journal workflows.

## Searching Tasks
- Use the Task panel's search feature
- Or use global search for `@tag` to find tagged tasks
- Or search for date ranges: `<2025-12`

**Find anything instantly.** Tasks are just text, so all search tools work on them.

## Advanced: Task Scripts
For power users: since tasks are plain text, you can process them with scripts:
- Export tasks to other tools
- Generate reports
- Analyze completion rates
- Create custom dashboards

Your vault is just files—use any tool you want.

## Next Steps
- Use calendar for dated tasks: [:Calendar|Calendar]
- Tag and search tasks: [:Search_and_Filtering|Search and Filtering]
- Link tasks to project pages: [:Links_and_Backlinks|Links and Backlinks]
