# Getting Started

ZimX is a local-first note editor built around a simple vault format:

- A vault is a folder on disk.
- Every "page" is a folder containing a same-named `.md` file (legacy `.txt` works too).
- Notes are plain Markdown, so they stay readable in any editor.

**Your notes stay yours.** No cloud account required. No subscriptions. No lock-in.

## Open Or Create A Vault
- Open an existing vault: `Vault → Open Vault`
- Create a new vault: `Vault → New Vault`
- Open a vault in a separate process/window: `Vault → Open Vault in New Window`

If you're just evaluating ZimX, create a vault in a normal folder you already back up (e.g. `~/Notes/MyVault`).

## What You See
The interface has three main areas:

- **Left**: the page tree (your folder structure)
- **Center**: the Markdown editor (your page content)
- **Right**: panels for tasks, calendar, attachments, links, and AI (toggled as needed)

**Fast, focused, and distraction-free.** The UI stays out of your way so you can think.

## Your First Workflow
1. Create a page (or use `Inbox`) for quick capture
2. Add links between related notes (see [:Links_and_Backlinks|Links and Backlinks])
3. Use search and filters to find things later (see [:Search_and_Filtering|Search and Filtering])
4. Press `F1` anytime to come back to this help vault

## Local-First By Design
ZimX does not require a cloud account to function. Your vault is just files on your machine. **Works offline. Always.** No internet? No problem. Your brain doesn't need Wi-Fi—neither does ZimX.
