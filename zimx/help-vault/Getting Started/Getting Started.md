# Getting Started

ZimX works with simple folders and Markdown files. A vault is just a folder on disk.

## Create or Open a Vault
1. Choose **Vault -> Open Vault** and select a folder.
2. ZimX reads the folder tree and builds the navigation view.
3. Your notes are regular `.md` files you can access outside of ZimX.

## Create Your First Page
- Use the left panel to create a new page.
- Type a title at the top as a heading.
- Save with Ctrl+S (or let autosave handle it).
