# Navigation

ZimX is designed so you can move between notes quickly without losing your place.

**Keyboard-first. Flow-friendly.** Stay in flow with powerful keyboard navigation. No constant mouse hunting.

## The Tree (Left Panel)
The tree mirrors folders in your vault:

- Each folder is a page
- The `.md` file inside has the page content (legacy `.txt` works too)
- Click a page to open it in the editor
- Expand/collapse with arrow keys or mouse

### Tree Actions
- **Right-click** on a page for context menu:
  - New Page
  - Rename (also `F2` when selected)
  - Delete
  - Open in Editor Window (separate floating editor)
  - Filter to this subtree
  - Collapse/Expand

### Filtering the Tree
You can filter the tree to show only a subtree:
- Right-click a page → "Filter to this subtree"
- Use bookmarks → "Filter nav from here"
- Clear filter with the "Clear nav filter" action

This is useful when working on a specific project or area—reduces visual clutter.

## History And "Go"
Use the `Go` menu for quick jumps:
- **G,H** → Home (vault root page)
- **G,T** → Tasks panel
- **G,C** → Calendar panel
- **G,M** → Attachments panel
- **G,L** → Link Navigator panel
- **G,A** → AI Chat panel

**Fast enough to stay out of your way.** These shortcuts keep your hands on the keyboard.

### History Navigation
- Use the back/forward buttons in the toolbar
- Navigate through your recent page history
- Great for bouncing between reference pages and active work

## Bookmarks
Pin frequently-accessed pages to the toolbar:
- Right-click a page in the tree → "Add Bookmark"
- Bookmarks appear as buttons in the toolbar
- Click to jump to that page instantly
- Right-click bookmark button for more options:
  - Open in Editor Window
  - Filter nav from here
  - Remove

## Open In A Separate Window
Sometimes you want a second "context window" (e.g., one window for your project notes and one for reference):

- `Vault → Open Vault in New Window` (launches a new ZimX process)
- Right-click a page → "Open in Editor Window" (floating editor for that page)
- `View → Open [Panel] Window` (floating panels)

For built-in docs, you can also press **F1** from anywhere in the app to open this help vault in a new window.

## Finding Pages
Don't remember where something is? Use search:
- Global search across all pages (see [:Search_and_Filtering|Search and Filtering])
- Tree search (type in tree view to filter by name)
- Link Navigator to see incoming/outgoing links (see [:Links_and_Backlinks|Links and Backlinks])

**Find anything instantly.** Search, backlinks, and filters work together to surface what matters.

## Heading Navigation
Within a long page, jump to headings:
- Press `t` in vi command mode (if vi mode enabled)
- Shows a filterable list of headings
- Select one to jump directly to it
