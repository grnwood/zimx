# Calendar

The calendar features are built around journaling and date-oriented notes.

**Built for years, not weeks.** ZimX is designed for notes you'll revisit months or years later.

## Today's Journal
Create or open today's page quickly:
- Menu: `Go → Today`
- Keyboard: `G,D` (if configured)

This creates a page based on today's date in your journal structure.

**Default structure**: `Journal/2025/December/2025-12-18/2025-12-18.txt`

You can customize the journal path in preferences.

## Calendar Panel
Open the Calendar panel: **G,C** or `Go → Calendar`

**Features**:
- Visual calendar showing which dates have journal entries
- Click a date to open or create that day's page
- See tasks and events associated with dates

## Why Use A Journal?

### 1. Captures Context Over Time
**Built for long-term thinking.** A daily journal keeps a record of:
- What you worked on
- What you learned
- Who you talked to
- Ideas that came up

Months later, you can answer "what did I do last Tuesday?" or "when did we discuss that feature?"

### 2. Low-Pressure Capture
Journal pages are forgiving:
- No need to organize perfectly
- Just dump thoughts and tasks
- Refactor into proper pages later when patterns emerge

**Starts simple, grows with you.** Use the journal for quick capture, then organize when ready.

### 3. Task Tracking
Combine tasks with journal entries:

```markdown
# 2025-12-18

## Morning
- [x] Team standup @work
- [ ] Review code for PR #456 @dev

Discussed the new feature with Sarah. She suggested...

## Afternoon
- [x] Write documentation @writing
- [ ] Schedule meeting with John @work <2025-12-19

Notes on documentation approach...
```

See [:Tasks|Tasks] for more on task management.

## Date-Based Workflows

### Daily Review
Create a template for daily pages:
```markdown
# {date}

## Tasks
- [ ] ...

## Notes
...

## Learnings
...
```

Store in `~/.zimx/templates/Daily.txt` and use when creating journal pages.

### Weekly Review
Create a "Weekly Review" page each week:
```markdown
# Week of 2025-12-16

## Accomplished
- Completed Project Phoenix design
- Fixed 12 bugs

## Next Week
- [ ] Start implementation @project-phoenix
- [ ] Schedule Q1 planning @work
```

Link to daily pages for details.

### Project Logs
Use dated pages within project folders:
```markdown
Project Phoenix/
  2025-12-18/2025-12-18.txt
  2025-12-19/2025-12-19.txt
  Project Phoenix.txt
```

The main project page links to daily logs.

## Calendar Integration
ZimX doesn't sync with external calendars, but you can:
- Copy events from calendar to journal pages
- Add tasks with due dates that show in Task panel
- Use journal as a work log alongside your calendar

**Your notes stay yours.** No external sync means no lock-in and no privacy concerns.

## Date Formats in Tasks
Use ISO date format for clarity:

```markdown
- [ ] Submit report <2025-12-31 @work
- [ ] Start research >2025-12-20 @project
```

The Task panel recognizes these and can filter/sort by date.

## Meeting Notes Pattern
Link meeting notes to journal entries:

**Journal page (2025-12-18)**:
```markdown
# 2025-12-18

## Meetings
- [:Meetings:Phoenix_Kickoff|Project Phoenix Kickoff] with Sarah, John

## Notes
Discussion went well, we decided...
```

**Meeting page**:
```markdown
# Project Phoenix Kickoff
*2025-12-18, attendees: Sarah, John, me*

## Agenda
...

## Action Items
- [ ] Draft requirements @me <2025-12-20
- [ ] Review mockups @sarah <2025-12-22
```

Now you can find the meeting through the journal or through the Meetings folder.
