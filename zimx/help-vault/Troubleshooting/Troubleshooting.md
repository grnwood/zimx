# Troubleshooting

## Vault Issues
- If a vault will not open, check folder permissions.
- If a vault is read-only, confirm write access.

## Remote Access
- Check your server URL and credentials.
- Re-authenticate if requests fail.

## Links and Attachments
- Broken links usually mean a renamed file.
- Missing attachments can be re-added by drag and drop.

## Performance
