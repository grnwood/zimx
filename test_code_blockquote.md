# Testing Code and Blockquotes

## Inline Code

Here is some `inline code` in a sentence.

You can also have `multiple` instances of `inline code` in one line.

## Code Blocks

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}")
```

```
SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10;
```

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.

> This is another blockquote with some longer text to see how it wraps.

> This is a blockquote.
>
> > Nested quote.

> Multi-line blockquote
> that continues on the next line
> and another line

## Combined

Here's some `code` and **bold** and *italic* together.

> A blockquote with `inline code` inside it.

```python
# Code block with comment
x = 42
```

> Blockquote followed by code:

```
code block after quote
```
